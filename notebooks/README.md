## Recreating Figures from Paper

If you would like to try recreating figures in the paper, you can easily do that with Google Colab. To do so:

1) Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2) Specify the source as a github repo at "https://github.com/colinoflynn/xdomain-dpa-m23/blob/master/notebooks/SAML11_Plotting_1.ipynb"
3) See instructions in the python notebook itself.
